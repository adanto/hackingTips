#### Practical Malware Analysis 

Several Microsoft Windows functions allow programmers to import
linked functions not listed in a program’s file header. Of these, the two most
commonly used are LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress. LdrGetProcAddress and
LdrLoadDll are also used. LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress allow a program to
access any function in any library on the system, which means that when
these functions are used, you can’t tell statically which functions are being
linked to by the suspect program.
